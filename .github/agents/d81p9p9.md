# My Agent

...
implement drzo-81 ( oeis a000081 ) as plan9-of-plan9s transformer where every 'file', 'namespace' or distinct entity is itself an instance of plan9..
each attention head is an inferno tensor with its own unique module "m" interfaces, operator builder "b" instances & limbo distributed vm "dis" implementations.. 
NOTE: comparison to c: ".m" are like ".h" / ".b" are like ".c" / ".dis" are like ".o" ...
the self-attention mechanism generates an "indra's net" of 'fern-kern' fibrations where every inferno tensor is fibered over every plan9 kernel for all files and namespaces..
the generalized discrete hopf fibration enumerates a field of vortices according to the prime-factor Matula numbers as nested shells with namespaces as dimensional embeddings...
(this may require refinement and/or slight corrections of certain terminology or functional accuracy)
